Fetch details about your remote repository.

## Description

repofetch is a CLI tool to fetch stats (think [neofetch] or
[onefetch]) that uses plugins for its implementation. The original version was focused on
repository stats, and any official plugin will be for repositories, hence the "repo" in
repofetch. With 3rd-party plugins, however, it can support other types of outputs, too.

## Installation

### Via RubyGems.org

```bash
gem install repofetch
```

### NetBSD (version <= 0.3.3)

Pre-compiled binaries are available from the [official repositories](https://pkgsrc.se/sysutils/repofetch)
To install this, simply run:

```bash
pkgin install repofetch
```

Or, if you prefer to build it from source:

```
cd /usr/pkgsrc/sysutils/repofetch
make install
```

You need to have `rust` and `libgit2` installed in order to build the package.

## Configuration

A file called `.repofetch.yml` in your home directory will configure repofetch. The
first time you run `repofetch`, the default configuration will be written to this file.

Files called `.repofetch.env` and `repofetch.env` in your home directory will set
environment variables for repofetch, via the [dotenv gem][dotenv]. These environment
variables can be useful for plugins that require secrets. The purpose of these files
is to separate secrets from configuration, so that, for example, you could add
`.repofetch.yml` to a dotfiles repository without compromising an API token.

You can find the absolute paths to these files with the `--help` option.

### Examples

```yaml
# .repofetch.yml
plugins:
  - 'repofetch/github'
```

```dotenv
# .repofetch.env
# Assuming you have gh (the GitHub CLI) installed
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)
```
