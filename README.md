### NetBSD
Pre-compiled binaries are available from the [official repositories](https://pkgsrc.se/sysutils/repofetch)
To install this, simply run:

```bash
pkgin install repofetch
```

Or, if you prefer to build it from source:

```
cd /usr/pkgsrc/sysutils/repofetch
make install
```

You need to have `rust` and `libgit2` installed in order to build the package.

## Configuration

The first time you execute `repofetch`, it will create a `repofetch.yml` file in your default
config folder. You can edit this file to change `repofetch`'s output.

You can find where `repofetch.yml` is saved by default by executing `repofetch --help` and viewing
the help for the `<config>` option.

### Config File Contents

- `emojis`

  These configuration settings lets you control which emojis display for each stat
  
  **Example**
  ```yml
  created: ðŸŽ‰
  ```
  
- `ascii`

  This configuration setting lets you change the ASCII art that is displayed
  
- `labels`

  This configuration setting lets you rename the labels used for certain stats
  
  **Example**
  ```yml
  good first issue: easy
  ```


- `GITHUB TOKEN`

  If you run `repofetch` multiple times in a short span of time, you may max out the
  amount of queries you can make to GitHub's search API. This will result in some stats
  being `???`. If you set the `GITHUB TOKEN` config option to a [personal access token][PAC],
  `repofetch` can use this value to query GitHub's search API more often.
